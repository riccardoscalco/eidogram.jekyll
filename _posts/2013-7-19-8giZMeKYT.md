A snap general election was held in Italy on 13–14 April 2008.
The following maps show the winner party and the *uncertainty to win* for every
Italian comune (the basic administrative division in Italy).


The *winner* is identifying as the party with the largest number of votes.

*This map could be misleading because the actual victory margin is completely
hidden. To have an idea of the uncertainty to win the following entropy
analysis could help.*

The uncertainty is calculated by means of the *Shannon entropy* on
the number of votes assigned to every party. For example, given the comune $$x$$ let's suppose that the three parties $$a$$,
$$b$$ and $$c$$ obtained $$v_a^x$$, $$v_b^x$$ and $$v_c^x$$ votes (the total
number of votes is $$v^x = v_a^x + v_b^x + v_c^x$$). Then the
uncertainty is calculated as the Shannon entropy $$\mathcal{H}(x)$$:

$$
\mathcal{H}(x) = -\sum_{p\in(a,b,c)} \frac{v_p^x}{v^x}\ln\frac{v_p^x}{v^x} =
- \frac{v_a^x}{v^x}\ln\frac{v_a^x}{v^x}
- \frac{v_b^x}{v^x}\ln\frac{v_b^x}{v^x}
- \frac{v_c^x}{v^x}\ln\frac{v_c^x}{v^x}
$$

Note that the entropy is not normalized to its maximum $$\ln v^x$$,
because the number of parties is nearly the same for every comune (such
normalization would result in a map proportional to the population map).

On the map, low and high values mean low and high uncertainty to win.
In other words, for a comune with low uncertainty it is easier to estimate who is the
winner than a comune with high uncertainty.
